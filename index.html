          <h2>Welcome to Allfire Design</h2>
          <p>
            Allfire Design is an independently owned wet fire design company,
            based in Brisbane, and servicing the whole of Queensland.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our ethos is simple. We design Deemed to Satisfy fire sprinkler and
            deluge systems to code requirements and have been doing so since
            1982.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have grown from a single operator to a design office utilising
            approximately 10 personnel comprising of both permanent staff and a
            small number of sub-contractors. All permanent staff have been
            trained in-house and attend external courses to keep skills and
            knowledge fresh. Our business has grown gradually and steadily over
            the years simply through word of mouth, and we are very proud of
            this fact.
